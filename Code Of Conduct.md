IV. Consequences of Violating the Code of Conduct
While we expect all team members to adhere to this code of conduct, occasional lapses may occur. To promote accountability in a lighthearted and engaging manner, the following fun penalties may be applied for minor violations:
Snack Provider Duty
The team member will bring snacks or treats for everyone at the next team meeting (virtual or in-person). If meeting virtually, consider sending digital gift cards or arranging a group food delivery.
Virtual Background Challenge
Use a humorous or themed virtual background (appropriate for all audiences) during the next video meeting to add a bit of fun to our session.
Joke of the Day
Kick off the next team meeting by sharing a clean, inclusive joke to lighten the mood and bring a smile to everyone's face.
Meeting DJ
Create a short playlist of instrumental background music to play softly during the next virtual work session, enhancing our collaborative atmosphere.
Storytime
Share a brief, funny, and appropriate anecdote or story at the next meeting to entertain and engage the team.
