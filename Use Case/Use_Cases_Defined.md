Population Information Reporting System

Use Case Title:

Population Information Reporting System for Country, City, and Capital Data



1. Description:

This use case describes the process of designing and implementing a system for generating various population reports from a pre-existing SQL database (world database). The reports will allow the organization to access and analyze population data at different geographical levels, including country, continent, region, city, and language.



2. Actors :

Scrum Team: Responsible for the design, development, and testing of the reporting system.

Product Owner: Defines the product backlog items (reports) and sets priorities for the Scrum team.

User: Requests population reports by providing filtering options such as region, continent, or top N populated areas.

SQL Database: The world database that contains the population data needed for generating the reports.

3. Preconditions:

The SQL database (world database) is accessible.

Scrum team has knowledge of SQL queries and database structure.

The system has a user interface (UI) for users to request and view reports.

4. Triggers

The user requests a population report through the system's user interface by specifying criteria such as continent, region, or top N populated areas.

5. Main Flow:

1. The user selects the type of report they want to generate from the following options:





Countries by population.

Cities by population.

Capital cities by population.

Population in continents, regions, and countries.

Language speakers by population.



2. The system displays a form allowing the user to:

Select a geographical level (e.g., world, continent, region, country).

Provide a numerical limit (N) to return the top N populated countries, cities, or capital cities.



3. The system retrieves the required data from the SQL database by executing the appropriate SQL query:

For countries: Select countries ordered by population from largest to smallest.

For cities: Select cities ordered by population from largest to smallest.

For capital cities: Select capital cities ordered by population from largest to smallest.

For population data: Retrieve total population, city population, and non-city population for the selected geographical area.



4. The system formats the retrieved data according to the following report types:

Country Report:

Columns: Code, Name, Continent, Region, Population, Capital.

City Report:

Columns: Name, Country, District, Population.

Capital City Report:

Columns: Name, Country, Population.

Population Report:

Columns: Name of geographical area, Total population, Population living in cities, Population not living in cities (including %).

5. The system displays the report on the user interface.



6. The user can export the report in a chosen format (e.g., CSV, PDF).



6. Alternate Flows:

6.1 If no data is available for the selected criteria:

6.1.1. The system displays an error message indicating no matching data.

6.2 If the user requests a top N report and provides an invalid N value:

6.2.1. The system prompts the user to enter a valid number for N.

6.3 If the database connection fails:

6.3.1. The system displays an error message and logs the issue for the development team.



7. Postconditions:

The requested population report is successfully displayed and available for export.

The data is retrieved accurately from the SQL database and presented in the required format.



8. Non-Functional Requirements:

Performance: The system should generate reports within 5 seconds for typical queries.

Scalability: The system should handle requests for large datasets (e.g., top 100 populated cities globally).

User Interface: The UI should be intuitive and easy to navigate for users requesting reports.

Security: The system must have appropriate access controls, ensuring that only authorized users can generate and view sensitive population data.



9. Assumptions:

The SQL database contains accurate and up-to-date population data.

The Scrum team has access to the necessary SQL database documentation and schema.

Users are familiar with how to interpret and use the population data generated by the system.



10. Dependencies:

SQL Database: The world database is essential for retrieving population data.

Reporting Tools: The system may rely on tools like Power BI or SSRS for advanced reporting and data visualization.

UI Framework: A user-friendly interface is needed for report generation and display.

Scrum Framework: The Scrum team must adhere to agile practices for continuous delivery and iteration.



11. Risks and Mitigation:

Risk: Database schema changes could impact the SQL queries and report accuracy.

Mitigation: The development team should establish a process for validating changes to the database structure and update queries as needed.

Risk: Performance degradation with large datasets.

Mitigation: Implement query optimization techniques and caching where applicable.



12. Scrum-Specific Considerations:

Product Backlog: Each report type (e.g., country report, city report, language report) can be a separate backlog item with individual user stories.

Sprint Planning: During sprint planning, the team will estimate and plan the development of the report generation system incrementally.

Sprint Review: The product owner and stakeholders will review each completed report type at the end of the sprint.

Sprint Retrospective: The team will assess and improve the process of building the reporting system after each sprint.
